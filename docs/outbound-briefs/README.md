# Sumble Strategic Outreach (Outbound) — Research Briefs

This directory holds **Outbound Strategic Research Briefs** — both the reusable template and completed instances. Briefs are produced via the Outbound Strategic Sales Motion documented in the main [Sumble Sales Brain](../Sumble%20Sales%20Brain.md) (see `## Workflows` → `Outbound Sales Brain — target deep-research methodology`).

## How to start a new brief

**Trigger phrase:** *"Create use case for [target]"* (single account) or *"Create use cases for [cluster name]"* (cluster — produces one brief per member).

1. Copy [`TEMPLATE.md`](TEMPLATE.md) to `{target-company}-{anchor-prospect}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md` in this directory.
2. Run the 10-phase Outbound Sales Brain methodology (Sumble MCP + WebFetch + WebSearch).
3. Fill every bracketed placeholder. No sections are optional.
4. Commit. The brief is now a permanent reference + reusable proof point.

## Single account vs. cluster runs

- **Single account:** one brief file. Sumble pitches one target (e.g., Gong) with one anchor prospect (e.g., LastPass).
- **Cluster:** N brief files in this directory, one per cluster member. Same methodology, different *intricacies* per company. The cluster's intricacy table lives in the methodology doc; each individual brief has its own complete file. Example cluster: Zendesk → Intercom → Freshworks → Salesforce Service Cloud → ServiceNow CSM → Forethought → Ada → HubSpot Service Hub → Genesys / NICE / Five9.

## What lives here

Each brief is a self-contained 9-section deliverable for a single outbound target company (the company Sumble is pitching). Every brief documents:

1. **TL;DR** — 2-line summary (problem + anchor + magnitude)
2. **Business Problem Sumble Solves For [Target]** — anchored to a public sales goal when one exists
3. **Anchor prospect** — `[NEW LOGO]` or `[WIN-BACK + EXPANSION]` tagged
4. **Why the anchor fits the trophy pattern**
5. **Financial frame** — segment-by-segment math
6. **Strategic frame** — trigger events, why now, why the window will close
7. **Buyer at the prospect** (per *target's* ICP)
8. **What Sumble surfaced** (that ZoomInfo / Apollo / 6sense / Clay / Demandbase cannot)
9. **The pitch the target should run**

Plus a **Methodology** block at the bottom documenting how the MCP query path produced the brief (essential for showing *how Sumble surfaced this*, which is part of the proof).

## Filename convention

`{target-company}-{anchor-prospect}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`

Example: `gong-lastpass-2026-05-06.md` — Sumble pitching Gong, with LastPass as the anchor prospect, brief produced on May 6, 2026.

## How briefs get made

Per the methodology:
1. Eric names the target company (or asks for a recommendation).
2. ~3 minutes of Sumble MCP research (~150–350 credits typical):
   - `GetMyCompanyProfile` (free) to refresh Sumble's persona/play context
   - WebFetch the target's homepage + customer-stories page
   - `EnrichOrganization` on the target — map their GTM data stack
   - `FindJobs` on the target — surface initiatives + spear-tip product
   - `FindPeople` on the target — build the persona shortlist
3. Phase 6.5 anchor query pre-validation — confirm ICP filter set + competitor set with Eric before spending search credits.
4. Anchor identified → verified via `EnrichOrganization` + `FindPeople` on the anchor → segment-by-segment pipeline math.
5. Brief drafted in this folder, then a persona-specific cold email drafted to Gmail with SFDC BCC.
