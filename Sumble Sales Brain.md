# Sumble Sales Brain — AE Knowledge & Playbook

This is Eric Fitz's personal AI context + sales playbook for selling at Sumble. Eric is an Account Executive at Sumble (eric@sumble.com), having recently moved from Zendesk. The goal of this file is to give Claude the context it needs to help with account research, territory planning, demo + value mapping, competitive positioning, and Command-of-the-Message-style discovery.

This is a knowledge file, not an automation system. There is no daily send loop, no Mail.app integration, no enrichment cron. Eric runs outbound through Salesforce + Gmail + standard sequences.

---

## Who Eric Is

- **Role:** Account Executive at Sumble (full-cycle / closing)
- **Email:** eric@sumble.com
- **CRM:** Salesforce
- **Email/Calendar:** Gmail / Google Workspace
- **Methodology:** Command of the Message / Force Management (value-based, pain-led, "before / after / proof / metric")
- **Prior role:** AE at Zendesk (selling CX/CS software). Useful priors: discovery rhythm, multi-threading at enterprise, MEDDPICC instincts, AppleScript/Mail.app outbound experience.
- **Focus areas at Sumble:**
  1. **Account research + territory planning** — interpreting Sumble signals to prioritize the right accounts and the right contacts within them.
  2. **Demo + value mapping** — translating Sumble's knowledge graph capabilities into specific buyer pains by persona (RevOps, CRO, CMO, ABM lead).

---

## What Sumble Is

Sumble is an AI-powered sales intelligence platform built around a **knowledge graph + LLM infrastructure** that turns unstructured public signals into coherent narratives about target accounts.

- **Founders:** Anthony Goldbloom and Ben Hamner (founders of Kaggle).
- **Funded:** $38.5M total — $8.5M seed (Coatue) + $30M Series A (Canaan Partners). Emerged from stealth October 2025.
- **Launched:** April 2024.
- **Coverage:** ~2.6M companies globally.
- **Reference customers:** Snowflake, Figma, Wiz, Vercel, Elastic (19+ enterprise customers as of late 2025).
- **Form factor:** Web app + API.

### What Sumble actually does

Sumble crawls social media, job boards, company sites, and regulatory filings, then connects the signals through a knowledge graph designed for LLM consumption. The output is a live view of a target account that includes:

- **Technographics by department** — not just "company X uses Salesforce," but which team uses what.
- **Org charts and team structure** — who reports to whom, who owns which initiative.
- **Key projects and initiatives** — what's actually being built or migrated.
- **Hiring trends** — surge hiring on a function = budget + buying intent.
- **Change events** — leadership shifts, reorgs, budget cycle moves, M&A.
- **Recommended contacts** — who to reach for a given motion.

### Core value prop (the thing that wins deals)

> "Pipeline and details that ZoomInfo and others miss."

ZoomInfo, Apollo, and Clay tell you **who** exists at a company. Sumble tells you **what's actually happening inside** — projects, team-by-team tooling, who owns what — so reps know not just who to email but **why now and what to say**. The wedge is *contextual depth at the team level*, not contact volume.

---

## Sumble's ICP (who we sell to)

Primary buyers, in priority order:

1. **Sales leaders** — CRO, VP Sales, VP RevOps, RevOps Director. They own pipeline efficiency and rep productivity. Pain: reps wasting time on bad accounts; ZoomInfo data is stale or shallow.
2. **Marketing leaders** — CMO, VP Demand Gen, ABM lead. They own targeting and segmentation. Pain: ABM lists built from firmographics + revenue alone don't reflect what's actually happening inside accounts.
3. **Enterprise revenue teams** — mid-market and enterprise sales orgs with established stacks (already have ZoomInfo / Apollo / Clay / Salesforce). They want a *layer of context* on top, not a rip-and-replace of their existing data tools.

### Where Sumble lands easiest

- Companies whose sales motion depends on **technographic signal** (devtools, infra, security, MarTech, MLOps, AI tooling — anyone whose ICP is defined by "uses X").
- Teams already running **multi-source enrichment** (Clay users especially) — Sumble is a unique signal, not a substitute.
- Enterprise GTM orgs with dedicated **RevOps + research** functions to operationalize the data.

### Where Sumble is harder

- Pure SMB outbound shops optimizing for cost-per-contact (Apollo wins on price).
- Teams that don't have someone to interpret signals — Sumble rewards thoughtful use, doesn't replace a rep's judgment.

---

## Competitive Landscape

The right framing: Sumble is **not** trying to be the contact database. It's the context layer **on top of** whatever DB the buyer already has. Lead with that — don't get sucked into a contact-count comparison with ZoomInfo or Apollo.

| Competitor | What they do | Where they win | Where Sumble wins |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ZoomInfo** | Deep B2B contact + intent DB, 100M+ profiles, ~$15K–40K/yr. Email accuracy 90–93%. | Contact volume, direct dials, scale. Enterprise default. | Department-level technographics, project-level signal, org context. ZoomInfo's intent is keyword-based; Sumble's is structured + behavioral. |
| **Apollo.io** | 275M contacts / 73M companies, generous free tier, built-in sequences + dialer. Cost-per-contact ~$0.002. | Cheap outbound execution. SMB / fast-moving teams. | Sumble doesn't compete on price-per-record. Wins when "we already have Apollo, why would we pay more?" → answer: *Apollo gives you contacts; Sumble tells you why those contacts matter this quarter.* |
| **Clay** | Data orchestration / waterfall enrichment across 150+ sources via spreadsheet UI. | Custom enrichment workflows, RevOps power-user love. | Sumble is **complementary**, not competitive — pitch it *as a Clay column*. Teams running Clay should be a fast yes when shown unique Sumble signal. |
| **HG Insights / Enlyft** | Tech stack / install-base specialists. | Mature technographic data, large enterprise contracts. | Department-level granularity (HG/Enlyft are company-level), plus org/project/hiring signal HG doesn't model. Plus modern UX. |
| **Common Room** | Community / PLG / dev advocate signals. | PLG companies tracking developer engagement. | Different problem — Common Room watches your community; Sumble watches the *outside world*. They co-exist; not a real competitive overlap, but RevOps teams sometimes lump them together. |

### Talk tracks by competitor

- **vs ZoomInfo:** "ZoomInfo tells you *who works there*. Sumble tells you *what they're working on*. Most enterprise teams keep both."
- **vs Apollo:** "Apollo is great execution rails. Sumble is the targeting brain that decides which accounts deserve those rails."
- **vs Clay:** "Clay is the kitchen. Sumble is one of the best ingredients. Teams running Clay add Sumble as a column."
- **vs HG Insights:** "HG sees the building. Sumble sees the rooms inside it." (Department-level granularity.)

## Competitive Battlecards

The high-level table above is the opener. Detailed battlecards live in [`battlecards/`](battlecards/) for moments when a buyer pushes on a specific competitor. Strategic landscape (market context, customer power quotes, brand positioning) lives in [`competitive-landscape.md`](competitive-landscape.md).

**Competitive voice principle (applies to every battlecard).** Recognize what they're using. Point out what that tool can't do. Never bash a competitor — it signals insecurity and breaks rapport.

Structure: *"Yes, [Competitor X] is strong at [Y]. Where teams add Sumble is for [what X can't do]."*

**Available battlecards:**

- [**Clay**](battlecards/clay.md) — complementary, not competitor. Sumble = who/when/why; Clay = how.
- [**Common Room**](battlecards/common-room.md) — strong on PLG / dark-funnel signal, weaker on technographic depth and outbound enterprise play mapping.

When a new competitor needs a battlecard, drop it in `battlecards/[slug].md` and add a one-liner above.

## Sumble's Plays / Value Narratives

The top eight plays — they're not mutually exclusive, most accounts fit 2+. Plays #1 and #2 are the **headline pair** for almost every customer conversation: MQL enrichment is the moment-of-truth motion, CRM enrichment is the always-on layer that makes it scalable.

**The lens for every play.** A play only earns its place in this list if it ladders to at least one of three outcomes for the buyer:

1. **Make their company money** — pipeline, ARR, NRR, win rate, deal size.
2. **Make their team more efficient** — time recovered, manual work eliminated, fewer tools to stitch together.
3. **Make their boss like them more** — visible wins, defensible decisions, sharper exec briefings, forecasts they can defend, presentations that look like leadership instead of analysis.

The strongest plays hit all three at once. Whenever a buyer pushes back on a play, locate which of these three you've failed to make concrete and fix that — don't add features.

### 1. ⭐ MQL enrichment — turn marketing-sourced contacts into sales-ready opps (HEADLINE PLAY)
The single highest-leverage motion for Sumble. Marketing already generates the contact (web form, gated content, event scan, ad click). Sumble enriches that contact with the **context** that decides whether it converts: *what's actually happening at their company, what initiatives they own, what signals say "this is real budget, not tire-kicking."*

- **Buyer:** Sales leadership (CRO, VP Sales) + Marketing leadership (CMO, VP Demand Gen). The pitch lands cleanest when both are in the room because it's the one play that makes both sides look better.
- **The problem we solve:** MQLs hit Salesforce as a name + email + company. Sales reps work them blind, or burn cycles on hand-research, or — most common — let 60–80% rot because they "don't know enough yet." Marketing gets blamed for "bad leads"; sales gets blamed for "not working leads." Both are right. Both lose.
- **Sumble unlock:** every MQL gets auto-enriched at the moment it lands with:
  - **Active initiatives at the account** (what they're hiring for, projects in flight, recent leadership moves) → *why now.*
  - **Pipeline drivers specific to that company** (what their stack reveals about budget cycle, team size, recent investment) → *what's the deal worth.*
  - **Differentiating angles** (the one signal that separates this account from the 50 others that look identical on firmographics) → *what to say in the first reply.*
  - **The right second contact** to multi-thread to, surfaced from the org graph, before the rep has to ask "who else should I be talking to?"
- **Outcome reps feel:** every MQL arrives with a 30-second briefing instead of a Google search. SDRs and AEs reply faster, more specifically, and to the right person.
- **Outcome marketing feels:** MQL → SQL conversion goes up; the "lead quality" debate ends because every lead carries its own context.
- **How to demo it:** take a real recent MQL from the prospect's CRM (or a peer's logo), show the unenriched record, then pull Sumble open and walk through the four bullets above live. The *contrast* is the demo.
- **Discovery questions:**
  - "Walk me through what happens when an MQL hits a rep's queue — what do they actually know about the account?"
  - "What's your MQL → SQL conversion rate? What does marketing think it should be?"
  - "How much time does a rep spend researching a single MQL before reaching out — and how much of that is Google + LinkedIn stitched together?"
  - "When a deal closes from an inbound lead, can you point to *what the rep said* in the first reply that made it work?"
- **Metric to anchor on:** MQL → SQL conversion rate (and time-to-first-meaningful-touch). If they don't measure either, that *is* the conversation.

### 2. ⭐ CRM enrichment — make sure AEs and reps target the right accounts with the right messaging (HEADLINE PLAY)
The always-on operational counterpart to Play #1. Where MQL enrichment fires at the *moment* a marketing-sourced lead lands, CRM enrichment is the **persistent layer** that lives across every account in Salesforce, so reps are working the right accounts with the right buying group and the right message — every day, not just at MQL touchpoints.

- **Buyer:** CRO + VP Sales (the rep productivity story) + RevOps (the data quality + integration story). Most champion: RevOps. Most decision power: CRO.
- **The problem we solve:** Salesforce account records are graveyards. Stale technographics, outdated org charts, no project signal, no play match, no messaging guidance. AEs do their best research on Tier-1 accounts, then run the rest of the territory blind. The 33%-attainment SMB / Mid-Market segments aren't a talent problem — they're a **signal-per-account problem.** Strategic AEs work ~4 deals a year on accounts they know cold (54% attainment); SMB AEs work 22-36 deals a year on accounts they barely know (33% attainment). The difference is signal density.
- **Sumble unlock:** every account in the territory gets enriched on a recurring basis with:
  - **Right account:** prioritized by current signal pattern (initiatives + hiring + tooling + change events), refreshed continuously — not a one-time score.
  - **Right buying group:** the 3–5 people inside the account who actually own the decision, surfaced from the org graph. Most aren't the contact already in Salesforce.
  - **Right play:** the specific play whose signal pattern fits this account *right now* (e.g., "Conversational AI hiring surge + IPO timing → AI Transformation play with [peer customer] proof").
  - **Right message:** the specific 2–3 signals an AE should lead with, plus the matched peer customer / proof point. Eliminates the "what do I say?" stall.
- **Where it lives:** Salesforce account fields + Outreach sequence personalization tokens. Reps don't open another tool — Sumble enrichment shows up where they already work.
- **Outcome reps feel:** every account in the territory is "warmed up" — the AE no longer chooses between 4 well-researched accounts and 30 dark ones. The reply rate gap between strategic and SMB outreach narrows because the *signal density* gap narrows.
- **Outcome leadership feels:** SMB / Mid-Market attainment moves toward strategic-AE numbers without changing headcount. Same reps, same quota, more pipeline.
- **Discovery questions:**
  - "Walk me through what's on a typical Salesforce account record when an AE opens it cold — what do they actually know?"
  - "What's the attainment gap between your strategic and SMB segments? What do you attribute it to?"
  - "When a rep needs to multi-thread, how do they figure out the buying group today — and how often is the contact already in Salesforce wrong or stale?"
  - "How specific is the average outbound email a rep sends? When did you last spot-check?"
  - "If every account in the territory had the same depth of context as your top 20, what would change?"
- **Metrics to anchor on:** segment-level attainment (SMB / Mid-Market vs. Strategic), pipeline-per-rep, MQL→SQL conversion (Play #1 lives downstream of CRM enrichment quality), reply rate on cold outbound.

### 3. Tech-stack-driven prospecting (displacement / attach)
Find buyers using competitor X (or complement Y) and reach the team using it.
- **Buyer:** AE-led RevOps; sales reps for displacement.
- **Sumble unlock:** *who* on the team uses the tool, not just whether the company uses it.
- **Common pattern:** "Show me every account using [Competitor] in their CS team but not in their Sales team — those are split-stack consolidation plays."

### 4. Hiring intent / job-posting signals
Surge hiring on a function = budget allocated = buying window opening.
- **Buyer:** SDR/AE, demand gen.
- **Sumble unlock:** structured hiring trends (Sumble normalizes job postings into roles + technologies + team growth deltas), not just "they're hiring."
- **Common pattern:** "Companies that hired 5+ Data Engineers in the last 90 days" → outbound trigger for data tooling.

### 5. Account prioritization for AEs
Score the territory so reps work the right accounts first. (Subset of CRM enrichment, but worth calling out as a standalone for buyers focused on territory design.)
- **Buyer:** CRO / VP Sales / RevOps.
- **Sumble unlock:** signals → score → ranked territory list. Replace gut-feel + ZoomInfo employee count with multi-signal model.
- **Common pattern:** Build a custom scoring rubric per persona/play; deliver as Salesforce-ranked list.

### 6. ABM list-building for marketing
Build target lists from firmographic + tech + signal filters.
- **Buyer:** CMO / VP Demand Gen / ABM lead.
- **Sumble unlock:** filters that other ABM tools don't have (e.g., "uses Snowflake AND hiring ML eng AND has VP-level Data role").
- **Common pattern:** Marketing builds the list in Sumble → exports to ad platforms / CRM / sequencer.

### 7. Renewal & expansion intelligence
The leading-indicator layer for the post-sale motion. CS tools fire after the damage; Sumble fires before it.
- **Who to contact:** Champion = VP Customer Success or VP Account Management. Economic buyer = CRO (NRR is on their dashboard). Customer Marketing lead is a strong influencer.
- **Why they care:** Renewals are still a Friday-afternoon Google session, expansion happens only when the customer brings it up, and champion churn is invisible until announced. ⚙️ *Efficiency:* CSMs stop manually researching every renewal. 💰 *Money:* a single 8-figure renewal saved or expanded pays for the contract many times over. 🎯 *Boss:* the CRO walks into a board meeting saying "we caught X churn risk and Y expansion six months early."
- **Sumble unlock:** champion leadership-change detection, new-department hiring at existing customers, competing-tool signals showing up in their job posts, RFP language. 3–6 months ahead of standard CS health-score tooling.
- **Discovery:** "Walk me through how a CSM finds out a champion has left — how fast?" / "When did your last big expansion start with a CS-side signal vs. a customer ask?"
- **Metric that improves:** NRR, GRR, gross retention dollars, time-to-expansion-signal.

### 8. Pre-call / pre-meeting briefings
Automated 1-page exec brief generated the moment a meeting hits the calendar. The "moment-of-meeting" complement to CRM enrichment.
- **Who to contact:** Champion = VP Sales Enablement or Chief of Staff to the CRO (this is often the actual buyer). Economic buyer = CRO. Heavy influencer = the strategic AEs themselves.
- **Why they care:** Reps under-prep for first meetings; execs join late and email AEs for a one-pager that doesn't exist; deals slip because the rep walked in cold. ⚙️ *Efficiency:* 30 min/meeting × N reps × the org = enormous time recovery. 💰 *Money:* meeting → next-meeting conversion lifts directly. 🎯 *Boss:* the CRO walks into customer meetings sounding sharp instead of asking the AE to brief them in the Uber.
- **Sumble unlock:** calendar-trigger briefing (initiatives, leadership moves, signal pattern, attendee backgrounds, suggested questions) delivered to email/Slack/Salesforce before the meeting starts.
- **Discovery:** "How does your CRO prep for a customer meeting today — and how does the AE feel about that workflow?" / "What % of first meetings convert to a second?"
- **Metric that improves:** meeting → meeting conversion, prep time per meeting, exec NPS on rep-prepared briefs.


### The unifying narrative

> *"ZoomInfo and Apollo gave you contacts. Sumble gives you the **context** that decides which contacts matter this quarter — and what to say to them."*

Lead with that. Then drop into whichever play fits the buyer in front of you.

## How We Sell — The Zendesk Brief as Style Reference

There's a real internal-discussion deck (`Sumble_Zendesk_MQL_3.html`) built for Zendesk that exemplifies how we sell at Sumble. **It is not a template to repeat for every prospect.** It's an example of the *style of selling* we want to do: value-based, specific to that buyer, anchored in their own strategic numbers, with real signal pulled live — not generic claims.

The reason to study it isn't to copy the slides. It's to internalize the moves.

### What the deck does well — the moves to repeat

- **Anchors in the buyer's own strategic number.** For Zendesk that was Eggemeier's public $500M AI ARR target → $700M pipeline gap. Every prospect has *some* version of this — a public target, an investor commitment, a quoted growth number. Find theirs. Don't pitch Sumble against a generic "improve conversion" claim.
- **Back into the number when there isn't a public one.** When the prospect hasn't disclosed a target, infer it from industry/segment math (avg ACV × new-rep headcount × coverage ratio). *"Each enterprise rep needs ~$5M coverage to hit number, multiply by 5 new hires"* lands harder than *"improve pipeline conversion."* Use the rebuilt sales team itself as the math anchor when the rebuild is the public signal.
- **Frame the play around what *their* reps need to accomplish.** Not what Sumble does. The pitch is about the pain *they* need to uncover at *their* prospects — brand consistency for content tools, GHAS displacement for secrets-detection, real-time CDC for ETL challengers, AD complexity for ITDR. Sumble's job is to surface that pain in the data. Position as their signal layer, not as a feature.
- **Uses one real, specific, non-obvious example.** Not "imagine a lead from a Fortune 500 bank" — a named senior banker at Morgan Stanley visiting the Zendesk help center, traced to Acko's $2–2.5B IPO mandate. The specificity is the point. If you can't find a real one for the prospect, don't fake it.
- **Shows before / after.** The generic email next to the Sumble-enabled email — *same hour, same lead, completely different outreach.* This is almost always the moment the buyer leans in. The contrast does the selling.
- **Connects signals into a narrative.** Hiring reqs + workforce restructuring + IPO timing + scale-of-operation isn't a data dump — it's a story about why the buyer should act now. Reps recognize this immediately because it's how they wish their own research worked.
- **Lands on a metric the buyer already cares about.** MQL→SQL conversion. Strategic-vs-SMB attainment gap. Pipeline-per-rep. Pick something already on their leadership dashboard; don't introduce a new metric.
- **Closes with a contained pilot.** "Run 90 days on a cohort. Pipe into Salesforce + Outreach. Roll out." Not a platform commitment — a measurable test.

### What we are *not* trying to do

- **Not a script.** Don't walk slides 1-through-18 with a prospect who hasn't earned them. Most pitches won't have a "$700M gap" hook because most companies aren't Zendesk.
- **Not a deck to send cold.** It's a framing exercise — internal thinking that a customer conversation can draw from, not a leave-behind.
- **Not Sumble-feature-led.** Notice how little of the deck is about Sumble's UI, data sources, or coverage. It's about the buyer's pipeline math and one specific lead. Sumble shows up in the contrast, not as the subject.

### The two emails — worth memorizing as voice reference

The deck's most reusable artifact is the side-by-side outreach. Read these as reference for *what specific, value-based outbound sounds like* — not as a literal template.

**Generic (what most reps send today):**
> Hi Oscar — I noticed you visited our help center recently. Just wanted to reach out and see if there's anything specific we can help you find. [Company] works with companies of all sizes to deliver world-class customer service. Happy to share more if you're exploring options. Best, David

**Specific (what Sumble enables):**
> Animesh — I'll be specific about why I'm reaching out, because I know the next 12 months at Acko are going to be ferocious. Morgan Stanley, ICICI, and Kotak just got named on the IPO. Your team is up to 9 Conversational AI reqs and 7 LLM engineer roles, and the April workforce restructuring around AI integration was a clear public signal. Meanwhile you're serving 75M users with ~1,300 employees across five metros — the math doesn't support staying on email-and-tickets through the DRHP window. This is the exact pattern we ran with Lush (369% ROI) and Siemens (23% productivity lift). Worth a 25-minute conversation? I'd loop in Rohan from your AI side.

The pattern in the second email — *named external trigger → quantified internal signal → operational tension → peer proof → low-friction CTA with a named second contact* — is the voice we want, scaled down to fit any prospect.

### The category claim worth carrying into every conversation

> *"Other tools tell you who they are. Sumble tells you what they're being mandated to do."*

Use it when a buyer compares us to ZoomInfo / Apollo / Clay. It's the single sentence that resets the frame from data-volume to context.

## Inbound vs Outbound Voice

Two different motions, same email rules. Don't mix them up — the wrong voice for the channel kills the message.

### Inbound (someone signed up — we're following up)

- **Where it comes from:** Slack alerts in `#unassigned-p0/p1/p2-leads-new-logos`.
- **What we have:** their actual Sumble usage in the thread (queries, filters, viewed orgs, paid exports, MCP sessions, Pro subscriptions).
- **Permission:** implicit — they opted in.
- **Open:** *"Welcome to Sumble."* / *"Welcome back."*
- **Backbone:** industry tension → their Sumble usage as receipt that we read them right → proposed play → low-friction reply.
- **Tone:** warm, peer-level. They've earned the casual register.
- **Workflow:** pull Slack thread → WebFetch their company for industry/GTM context → draft. ~10 min per lead.

### Outbound (we picked the target — they don't know us)

- **Where it comes from:** territory plan, TAM list, 1:1 priority pursuit.
- **What we have:** public signals via Sumble MCP — hiring trends, in-flight projects, leadership moves, tech adoption, change events.
- **Permission:** must be earned in the message itself.
- **Open:** named external trigger — a public move, industry inflection, or specific event at their company.
- **Backbone:** external trigger → quantified internal signal (from MCP) → operational tension that signal implies → optional peer proof → specific next step or low-friction reply.
- **Tone:** business-led, sharper. Earn attention with specificity, not warmth.
- **Sales Brain reference:** the **Animesh / Acko Zendesk-deck email** above is the outbound gold standard, not an inbound shape.
- **Workflow:** pick target → `GetMyCompanyProfile` (free) → `EnrichOrganization` + `FindJobs` + `FindPeople` on target → synthesize *"why now"* → identify the right buyer in the org graph → draft. ~20 min per account.

### What both share

- Email rules in full: plain text, subject under 40 chars, under 100 words total, no sentence over 20 words, no bullets / numbered lists / em-dashes, sign off `Eric / Account Executive | Sumble`.
- Lead with an observation about THEM, not us.
- One specific data point per email — the more concrete, the better.
- Vary openers across a batch.

### The biggest mistake

Running inbound voice (*"welcome to Sumble, you ran 200 queries"*) on an outbound target who never signed up — they'll bounce. Conversely, opening inbound with formal outbound ceremony (*"I'll be specific about why I'm reaching out, because…"*) wastes the warmth they gave you by signing up.

---

## Discovery — Command of the Message Cuts

Run discovery on **before-state pain → required capabilities → metrics → proof**. The four required capabilities Sumble delivers, with discovery questions for each:

### Capability 1 — Account-level context (not just contacts)
- "Walk me through how a rep decides which 50 of their 500 accounts to work this week."
- "When a rep opens an account in [ZoomInfo / Apollo], what do they actually learn about what's happening inside?"
- "How often do reps email someone who's already churned out of the role they're targeting?"

### Capability 2 — Department-level technographics
- "When you say a company 'uses Snowflake' — do you know whether it's the Data team, the Analytics team, or just one engineer's POC?"
- "How do you target plays where the buyer is a specific *team* inside a company, not the company as a whole?"

### Capability 3 — Hiring + project signals as buying triggers
- "What's the trigger today that tells your team an account is *in market*?"
- "When a company hires 10 ML engineers, how does your team find out, and how fast?"
- "How do you separate noise hiring from a real org build-out?"

### Capability 4 — Org + project context for messaging
- "When a rep writes a cold email, what do they personalize on?"
- "How often do reps have to ask 'who runs [function] there?' and just guess from LinkedIn?"

### Metrics to anchor on (Force Management style)
- Pipeline conversion: outbound → meeting → qualified opp → close.
- Rep productivity: hours/week on research, accounts worked per rep, meeting set rate.
- Marketing efficiency: CAC by ABM list source, MQL → SQL conversion.
- Data spend ROI: dollars on stack (ZI + Apollo + Clay + ours) vs. opps sourced.

---

## Demo Flow (default narrative, adjust for buyer)

The arc: **broken status quo → Sumble's unique signal → tactical use → org-level outcome.**

1. **Open with the buyer's account** — pull their company in Sumble live, show what we know. Wins attention every time.
2. **Find a peer/prospect they care about** — show department-level tech stack + one project signal + a hiring trend.
3. **Walk one play end-to-end** — pick the play that matches their pain (usually #1 or #3 above).
4. **API + integration moment** — show Salesforce attach / Clay column / direct list export. Map to *their* stack.
5. **ROI math** — the metric they cared about in discovery, mapped to Sumble's unlock.

Per-persona shading:
- **CRO:** lean on rep productivity + pipeline conversion. Avoid feature soup.
- **RevOps:** lean on data quality + integration. They'll demo it themselves; don't over-narrate.
- **CMO/ABM:** lean on list-building filters + ABM-platform handoff.
- **SDR/AE direct user:** lean on the personalization moment ("write the cold email with this open in front of you").

## Common Things Eric Will Ask Claude

| Eric says | What Claude should do |
|---|---|
| "Research [company] for me" | Pull what's publicly known: tech stack hints, recent news, leadership changes, hiring trends, likely Sumble plays for that account, suggested contacts to target. Cross-reference Sumble MCP if available. |
| "Help me prep for [persona] at [company]" | Persona pain → discovery questions → likely objections → competitive context (what they probably already use) → suggested Sumble play. |
| "Draft a cold email to [contact] at [company]" | Command-of-the-Message style: lead with their team's specific signal (not Sumble), one observation, one tight value statement, low-friction CTA. Plain text, under 100 words, subject under 40 chars. (Same email rules Eric uses from Zendesk days.) |
| "What's the play for [account]?" | Match account profile → ICP fit → which of the four plays applies → talk track. |
| "Build me an ABM list for [criteria]" | Translate criteria into Sumble-style filters (firmographic + tech + signal + person filters), suggest the export path, flag credit cost considerations. |
| "Compare us to [competitor]" | Use the competitive matrix above. Lead with the framing (context layer, not DB), don't get pulled into contact-count debates. |
| "What's a good discovery question for [pain]?" | Use the Command-of-the-Message capability buckets above; tie the question to a metric. |

---

## Email + Outreach Rules (carried over from Zendesk hub)

These are Eric's personal preferences, not Sumble policy. Worth keeping consistent because they work.

- **Plain text only.** No HTML, no bold, no italics, no link brackets.
- **Subject line under 40 characters** — won't truncate on mobile lock screens.
- **2–3 short paragraphs**, blank line between each.
- **No sentence over 20 words.** No bullets, no numbered lists, no em-dashes.
- **Under 100 words total.**
- **Lead with an observation about THEM** — a specific signal from Sumble, a hiring trend, a project, a leadership move. Not about Sumble.
- **One specific data point.** "You hired 12 data engineers in Q3" beats "I noticed you're growing."
- **Low-friction CTA:** "10 min, no pitch" style.
- **Vary openers across a batch.** Never repeat the same first line.
- **Sign off:**
  ```
  Eric
  Account Executive | Sumble
  ```
- **BCC Eric's Salesforce email-to-record drop address** on every prospect draft (inbound follow-up or outbound first-touch) so it auto-logs to the Lead/Contact in SFDC. The literal address lives in Eric's local Claude memory (`salesforce_bcc.md`), not in this repo (public).
- **Sequencing:** all sends go through Salesforce + Gmail with native tooling. No autonomous send. No Mail.app loop. No 200/day cap (that was a Zendesk-era system).

## What NOT to Do

- **Do not** position Sumble as a ZoomInfo/Apollo replacement in early conversations. It's a context layer on top of whatever they already use. The replacement framing only comes up if the buyer brings it up first.
- **Do not** lead with features. Lead with their account's signal pulled live from Sumble.
- **Do not** quote contact-count comparisons against Apollo. We will lose that comparison; it's the wrong frame.
- **Do not** over-promise on coverage outside the ~2.6M companies Sumble crawls — confirm coverage before committing on enterprise targets in long-tail geographies.
- **Do not** carry over Zendesk-specific automation patterns (Mail.app sender, 200/day cap, prospects.json state machine). This brain is for knowledge + AI assist, not autonomous outreach.
- **Do not** assume any account is already a Sumble customer unless verified. Reference list as of late 2025: Snowflake, Figma, Wiz, Vercel, Elastic, plus ~14 others. Verify before pitching.

## MCP / Tooling Available to Claude

- **Sumble MCP** (`claude.ai Sumble`) — Eric's primary research tool. Available functions include `FindOrganizations`, `FindPeople`, `FindJobs`, `EnrichOrganization`, `EnrichPerson`, `SearchTechnologies`, `MatchOrganizations`, `RunSqlQuery`, `GetMyCompanyProfile`, `GetAccountInformation`, plus list management. Always call `GetMyCompanyProfile` once per session (free) to ground context. Watch credit balance — 402 = out of credits.
- **Gmail MCP** — read-only inbox scanning for replies/bounces. Drafting via Salesforce sequences, not Gmail directly.
- **Google Calendar MCP** — meeting scheduling and prep.
